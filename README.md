## Introduction
###  Objective
The goal of this project is for Sawyer to navigate a ball through a maze using vision feedback.

### Equipment
1. Sawyer Robot
2. ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04
3. Maze
4. Ball
5. Camera and Tripod

### Maze Design and Fabrication
A Sawyer [gripper mount](https://github.com/anapervan/Sawyers-Travels/blob/master/CAD/stl/Gripper%20Mount.stl), [spacers](https://github.com/anapervan/Sawyers-Travels/blob/master/CAD/stl/Spacer.stl), and a [maze base](https://github.com/anapervan/Sawyers-Travels/blob/master/CAD/stl/Maze%20Base.stl) were designed using OnShape. These were laser cut and glued together so that they could be attached to the Sawyer, and any maze with the same corner mounting holes could be attached or removed using screws.

Next, a [maze](https://github.com/anapervan/Sawyers-Travels/blob/master/CAD/stl/Maze%201.stl) was designed, cut, and painted blue. The maze base was painted black, so that the camera could clearly differentiate between the walls and the background.
